>&quot;The beginning is the most important part of the work.&quot;

Hi everyone, today I would like to share some tips for beginner developers. This post will include those packages, which I install on every new machine I own.

<h2>1. fish shell<small> user-friendly</small></h2>
Definitely, this is the best and most user-frienly shell I have ever seen. 

One of fish’s best features is autocompletion. It knows what you’re thinking, and will gladly save you the keystrokes by finishing your command for you. Just press Tab.
Although it’s an innovative feature, at least as far as terminal shells go, it’s not all that complicated. It makes its assumptions based upon a combination of guesswork, and your command line history.

Supports macOS, Windows, Linux and even tarball.

<h2>2. Python 3<small> simple &amp clean</small></h2>
