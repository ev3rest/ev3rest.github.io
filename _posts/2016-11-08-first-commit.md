>&quot;The beginning is the most important part of the work.&quot;

Hi everyone, today I would like to share some tips for beginner developers. This post will include those packages, which I install on every new machine I own.

<h2>1. fish shell<small> user-friendly</small></h2>
Definitely, this is the best and most user-frienly shell I have ever seen. 


One of fish’s best features is <b>autocompletion</b>. It knows what you’re thinking, and will gladly save you the keystrokes by finishing your command for you. Just press Tab.

Although it’s an innovative feature, at least as far as terminal shells go, it’s not all that complicated. It makes its assumptions based upon a combination of guesswork, and your command line history.


Supports macOS, Windows, Linux and even tarball.

<h2>2. Python 3<small> simple & clean</small></h2>
Python is often compared to other interpreted languages such as Java, JavaScript, or Perl. <b>Python is a simple language.</b>


By this I mean that the syntax of Python is extremely easy to learn and read. Python code is not that far off from actual English and pretty damn close to psuedocode. Sometimes, I'll copy psuedocode from Wikipedia, add a few colons and then I have a working Python program. And plus look at the turnary operators in Python vs C++



Python:

<code>X = "hello" if True else "world"</code>

C++:

<code>X = true ? "Hello" : "world";</code>

Which one is more readable?




<b>Despite (or perhaps because of) the simple syntax, it's extremely expressive.</b>

When writing up a Python program, I can express the same amount of logic in three lines that takes me 7 in C++.

Plus you have all these really nice builtins

Things like packing and unpacking, generators, default arguments, the fact that almost everything is an object, the builtins libraries like functools, urllib, etc… really gives more power to the programmer.


<b>And there are a dozens of libraries.</b>

There is a library for almost anything you want to do. Want to send texts? Twilio’s Python library will help you. Want to make requests but don't want to use URLLib? Use requests. Want to parse a web page? Beautifulsoup has got you covered. Want to do some encryption, you got pycrypto. And I'm aware there are a ton of libraries for a ton of languages, but they just don't feel the same as Python.

<b>All this culminates to create a language that causes a programmer to feel great and more productive.</b>

It probably takes 4–5x as long to build a C++ program over a Python program.

Theres so much more to Python than I described. It's a great language and you should definitely try it out.
